Sprint Review:
a. What did you learn from doing our first sprint?

In our first sprint we learned that communication and strategic planning goes a long way when the actual implementation of the work and project needs to be incorporated. Although planning ahead and subdividing the project work into user stories takes time, it was ultimately found to be helpful and provided a good structure for the team to follow and stay organized. 
We also learned a lot about the project requirements from our client during the first sprint. Being able to collaborate with our client and understand their needs in depth was helpful in creating our prototype and the main page of our website. 

b. What went well? Why?

Dividing the project into user stories and allowing everyone to work on stories of their choosing was helpful in managing tasks while still fostering accountability and productivity. Once the user stories were created and made known, everyone was able to be very productive. Meeting with Joseph, our client, also went really well. Meeting with him allowed us to understand his ideas and goals while simultaneously allowing him to understand our capacity and capabilities. 

c. What didn’t go well? Why not?
In the beginning of the sprint, the team had difficulty in determining what tasks needed to be done and how exactly everything was going to be organized throughout the project, including the use of CASE tools, the communication with our client, and the development of a prototype and functional page. The determination of these items took longer than expected, but once the team was able to figure these components out, we were able to increase our productivity and efficiency. The team also had difficulty in determining and scheduling times to work with all team members present. Understanding each other’s schedules and establishing other key methods of communicating such as through email and text ended up being really helpful and led to faster and direct communication. 


d. How can you make things better next time?

Next sprint, we plan on taking the time to do an elaborate sprint planning meeting where we figure out what needs to be done and how we can most effectively accomplish what needs to be done. This first sprint has allowed us to understand and get the hang of how sprints work, and after our first exposure in an environment like this, we now know what worked well and what didn’t work well for us. Additionally, by spending more time on strategic sprint planning in the beginning of the sprint, we will save a lot more time and reduce inefficiencies towards the end of the sprint. 

e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?

As a team who is experiencing working within a sprint for the first time that involves the use of CASE tools, prototypes, implementation, and a real client, we are pretty satisfied with everything we have been able to accomplish within the past sprint. Now that we know and understand how sprints work and how our tools will help us to succeed, I think our productivity as a team will only continue to grow. In terms of knowledge, our team is also satisfied with all the new information, procedures, and strategies we have learned throughout this process. Although learning about Scrum and agile methodologies in class is very useful, experiencing these practices hands on has been a really satisfying learning experience. 

f. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?

The other group working for the client of  a small service IT provider was invited to our sprint review. Similar to us, they also experienced difficulties in the beginning of their sprint but were able to surpass these difficulties as the sprint carried on. One observation we had about the other team’s project was their use of Bulma throughout their main page. Incorporating Bulma into their website allowed them to have some cool design aspects that our team thought was interesting and worth the efforts of looking into. Everyone was present at this sprint review and this was an interesting opportunity to collaborate with others and share advice amongst ourselves.
