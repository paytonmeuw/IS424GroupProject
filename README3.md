Burndown Chart at Project’s Completion

Daily Scrum #1:
Ashley:
a. What did you do yesterday?
Began working on implementing the connection of signing in and loging on the website with the google firebase.
b. What are you planning to do today?
Finish establishing the login and sign up tabs in the navigation bar, and if possible work on implementing a loggedin and loggedout function for the rest of the website.

c. Any problems are you facing?
I keep getting errors when in the console when trying to use the sign up and login button. This means that there are problems within the javascript that need to be fixed before I can work on the loggedin and logged out functions.

Yifan:
a. What did you do yesterday?
Worked with the team to consolidate the codes, and also worked on displaying images through urls stored in the database.

b. What are you planning to do today?
I plan to work on the search button and make sure that the website will return the coworking spaces that users are looking for based on the checkboxes they checked.

c. Any problems are you facing?
I spent a lot of time searching for how to display images stored in the database.

Ethan:
a. What did you do yesterday?
I spent yesterday taking some focused time to reorganize our burndown charts for this specific sprint and ensure I can save time when pulling these out at the conclusion of the sprint.

b. What are you planning to do today?
Finishing up associated work with the burndown chart creation and working on some website formatting issues.

c. Any problems are you facing?
I was testing some concepts in our code.html file and I need to decide which of my changes should be committed and which ones I should delete.

Abhi:
a. What did you do yesterday?
Worked on shifting everything to bulma and making everything a single page website.

b. What are you planning to do today?
I plan on creating a nav bar to change the header of the website and add a page for available spaces along with a sign up, login, and sign out button. Also, make sure to email Joseph to communicate when he is available to get some feedback on how our website looks.

c. Any problems are you facing?
Sometimes the modal wasn’t working for the sign up so I had to really look at all the id’s I created and see if they properly correlated with one another.

Payton:
a. What did you do yesterday?
Starting looking at ways to actively show database content on the website. Reviewed some class code to try to find related activities.

b. What are you planning to do today?
Work with the professor during class to develop correct code to show database information.

c. Any problems are you facing?
A little unsure of code since we have not done exact things in class. Hoping to relieve these problems with help from the professor.

Daily Scrum #2:
Ashley:
a. What did you do yesterday?
Successfully got the sign up, sign in, and sign out features to work on the website. Began looking at creating the loggedin and loggedout functions of previous projects to pull in and incorporate within Coworking Madison
b. What are you planning to do today?
I plan on completing the loggedin and loggedout functions in order to get the website to show features only users who are signed in can see. This would also involve including class lists within the html of the website.
c. Any problems are you facing?
My loggedin and loggedout functions are correct and are not presenting errors in the console, but are still not working in the actual presentation of the website. I think there might be an error with my classes but plan on investigating this today as well and additionally get guidance from the professor.

Yifan:
a. What did you do yesterday?
Finished the search button and the filter part. Both the search button and checkboxes work now. Deleted unnecessary codes and images.

b. What are you planning to do today?
I plan to go through all the codes to make sure that there is no error or redundancy.

c. Any problems are you facing?
The filter part is complicated, and I have no idea how to do it at the beginning. I spent a lot of time thinking about it.

Ethan:
a. What did you do yesterday?

Worked with the group to identify ways we could convert the application to a single page using specific HTML and Javascript functions.

b. What are you planning to do today?

Experimenting with dieplaying parts of the website using javascript triggers, allowing our application to be housed on a single page.

c. Any problems are you facing?

I was initially using the InnerHTML function to try and rewrite some of the site’s content, but this was difficult to implement. Instead, I am now using a written function that changes the display associated with specific DIVs.

Abhi:
a. What did you do yesterday?
Kept working on bulma and made sure to reply to Joseph about setting up a meeting time for the upcoming Thursday during the afternoon.

b. What are you planning to do today?
Continue to work with Ashley and Ethan on converting everything to a single-page interface and look at how to get the checklist to match with the database. Work with Ethan on how to make websites dynamic with clicks and make certain content disappear when new pages are clicked on.

c. Any problems are you facing?
Some of the clicking wasn’t always working and getting content to disappear as well. Had to find a different method than ones we have used in previous courses to get the content to be truly dynamic and a single-page website.

Payton:
a. What did you do yesterday?
Helped teammates work out some of their problems with authentication, bulma, and switching code to a single page. I also deployed the updated work on firebase to make sure our website link is accurate.

b. What are you planning to do today?
I am planning to create a javascript testing file based on what we learned in class. I am also hoping to make some edits to the sprint and milestone to get closer to completion.

c. Any problems are you facing?
No problems besides the stress of the fast approaching deadline.

Sprint Review:

a. What did you learn from doing our 3rd sprint?

The first thing we learned was how large this project truly was. If we hadn’t worked slowly on this project throughout the semester we never would have gotten the results we did. It was a lot of work but it felt better to do it in smaller sections.
The next thing we learned was how to support our teammates. We had some members who were more skilled than others in terms of coding which was the majority of the work for the 3rd sprint and milestones 3b and 4. Because of this, the less skilled coders tried to find ways to still improve the project and take a solid portion of the work that still needed to be done. Whether this was working on the final report or working in the database, we all tried to contribute our strengths.

b. What went well? Why?

I think it went well to have time with the professor to get feedback and help on our project. We worked both in class and in office hours to resolve problems to learn new code to advance our project. We had not been given this much time to work with the professor until this sprint and it came at a very helpful time.

c. What didn’t go well? Why not?

This sprint was more difficult because of the fact that we decided to switch our project to using bulma and to be a one page application. This change came after we received feedback from the professor that he would recommend for us to do it this way. This was difficult because we had most of the original code working within multiple files but had to change it all. It was a lot of work and we had wished we received this feedback earlier to initially code a one page application using bulma.
The timing of this sprint also brought some difficulties. Since it started right after the thanksgiving break we felt like there was less motivation in the first week. We were all coming off a relaxing break at home and it was difficult to jump back into the project. By the second week our work picked up as we approached the deadline for milestone 4. The timing was also difficult due to the exam we had during the first week of the sprint. We didn’t have as much time during the first week for project work since we were all so focused on studying the exam topics.

d. How can you make things better next time?

Things could be better next time by having more sessions with the professor to get feedback. This would help us learn what he recommends from his perspective. It would also help us get through some roadblocks we faced faster when teammates could not help.

e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?

With the knowledge and skills we currently have we are satisfied with what we have completed. There are a few features we attempted to work on that were much too difficult in terms of code. If we had more time to implement these we would have obviously been more satisfied with our work.

f. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?

We invited Noah from the other group to check out our project. He liked the look of our website and how it was clear and concise for what we were providing. Additionally, he liked the checkbox filtering of how you could get more specific to what coworking space fits a user needs. He added that he thinks it would be cool to have a list of all the spaces users have favored so they could come back to it whenever they log in.
