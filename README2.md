Daily Scrum Meeting #1:

Ashley

a. What did you do yesterday?

Created a context level diagram and the level 0 data flow diagram. Reviewed these diagrams with the team and made adjustments accordingly. 

b. What are you planning to do today?

Begin research and data extraction on the coworking sites available around Madison. I am going to gather the name, hours, contact information, description, cost range, and details of the coworking spaces and put them into a google sheet for the team to access. 

c. Any problems are you facing?

Currently my VSCode is having problems in fetching and pulling data from Github. Errors keep arising and I am having difficulty troubleshooting why this is happening. 

Ethan

a. What did you do yesterday?

Did research to properly set up the sprint burndown chart tracking using the trello embedded tools instead of microsoft excel or an alternative external tool.

b. What are you planning to do today?

Finalize the sprint tracking of information using trello and experiment with ways to properly visualize information in a way that helps the team.

c. Any problems are you facing?

It is difficult to define different time based tracking windows within trello, and linking the board directly to our existing tickets and backlog is proving difficult.

Abhi

a. What did you do yesterday?

Assisted with drafting diagrams. 

b. What are you planning to do today?

Complete diagrams. 

c. Any problems are you facing?

Not currently. 

Yifan

a. What did you do yesterday?

Based on the data flow diagram level 0, I finished the data flow diagram level 1.Reviewed the diagrams with the team and made adjustments accordingly. 

b. What are you planning to do today?

Design and finish prototype page 2&3 using Justinmind.

c. Any problems are you facing?

Not sure whether the prototype falls under the criteria Joseph is looking for. 

Payton

a. What did you do yesterday?

Set up a website for hosting on firebase and shared links.

b. What are you planning to do today?

Start working on use cases and activity diagrams. 

c. Any problems are you facing?

Not at the moment. 


Daily Scrum Meeting #2:

Ashley

a. What did you do yesterday?

Began researching and filling out data in the coworking space spreadsheet within the drive. I have found about 13 local coworking spaces within Madison and have filled out a third of the research. 

b. What are you planning to do today?

Finish the completion of the research within the google sheet. Add more data and look for additional workspaces within the area. 

c. Any problems are you facing?

Difficulty in finding consistent information throughout the websites. Some websites contain information on the number of offices they have while others do not. This is also true when searching for email information and specific details such as parking. 

Ethan

a. What did you do yesterday?

Finalized the spring tracking system in Trello and began investigating some of the various coworking spaces within the Madison area. 

b. What are you planning to do today?

I plan to continue looking up various coworking spaces within Madison, analyze their websites and price points, and strategize easy ways to get data and info about these spaces within a centralized location for the team. 

c. Any problems are you facing?

Some of the smaller coworking spaces have very limited social media presence and outdated websites, making it difficult to get the same level of detailed information on each coworking space. 

Abhi

a. What did you do yesterday?

Added content to footer of the website.

b. What are you planning to do today?

Start working on creating a filter for the website. 

c. Any problems are you facing?

Needed to do some review of code to remember how to make it work. 

Yifan

a. What did you do yesterday?

Design and finish prototype page 2&3 using Justinmind.

b. What are you planning to do today?

Finish the creation of the sign up button and sign in button and make the two buttons work. 

c. Any problems are you facing?

It took me a long time to review how to write the code in Javascript to make the buttons work. 

Payton

a. What did you do yesterday?

Set up a database on firebase based on the draft team created. I also added the firebase configuration info to a html file and shared to github for the team. 

b. What are you planning to do today?

Research coworking space information. Fill the database with true coworking space information. 

c. Any problems are you facing?

Some issues collaborating since I am the only person with access to the firebase interface to see the database as it's updated. 


Sprint Review:

a. What did you learn from doing our first sprint?

Communication is incredibly important in making the most of everyone’s time. During our first sprint, we realized that everyone on the team is very busy and has a lot of different responsibilities they have to handle. Because of this, we’ve had to be very flexible and communicative when working together to ensure that everyone can contribute to the team in meaningful ways that also fit their schedule. We’re now very quick to text one another and organize zoom meetings whenever necessary to make sure everyone is doing their own work and we don’t waste time researching the same information or coding similar features without discussing it together. 

b. What went well? Why?

As discussed above, the group’s level of communication and coordination throughout the sprint worked incredibly well. This let us stay in contact throughout the sprint and allowed all of our work to be very efficient. Beyond us, the design of our backend databases was a strong process. We were able to create our context and related diagrams very quickly, and subsequently set up our firestore database with little work. We actually saved time on this process as compared to what we expected to spend on it. 

c. What didn’t go well? Why not?

Researching and acquiring data on various coworking spaces proved to be a lengthy and difficult process. Because every coworking space website and online presence is unique, there was no way to guarantee that the same data could be collected for each site we found. As such, there are some “holes” in our data where we were unable to find data points or answer questions related to some of the coworking spaces. While our NoSQL database allows for the data to be organized in this kind of manner, we still wish that more information could’ve been found on each space. This process also was much more time consuming than we anticipated.

d. How can you make things better next time?

Going forward, we can work to be a bit more conservative in our time estimates for specific tasks. As it relates to the data collection in particular, we were overly optimistic in our ideas about how long the process would take and this led to wasted time and some team members having to take on extra work unexpectedly. Because of this, we will take more time in the sprint planning phase of our process going forward, and ensure that we are baking in extra time when estimating the workload of each tack we evaluate. 

e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?

As a team we are quite satisfied with what has been completed so far. At present the website has a clean and understandable UI, we’ve fully outlined the design and setup of our backend database, and we’ve collected all of the data we believe is necessary to give good information to end users of the site. This is exactly where we hoped to be at the conclusion of sprint 2, and all that is left to do is properly populate the database, fully launch the site, and perform the necessary testing to verify it is all working properly. 

f. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? 

We invited the other group. Noticed that they have made a lot of progress throughout this sprint. 

Everybody was present?

Yes, all members were present during the necessary meetings and sprint planning/standup/review sessions. This allowed us all to communicate well and stay on the same page as the logical and actual design of our site had become more complex.
